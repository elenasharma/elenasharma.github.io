  <article class="post-content">
  <h3 id="youtubeyoutube"><a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></h3>
<p>YouTube is one of my favorite sites because of all the content I can access from it - plus, I’ve been a YouTube member longer than any other site, since I first joined it eight years ago now. Because of all this time I’ve been able to create a large number of playlists organizing the videos I’ve watched and liked over the past decade that I can still revisit whenever I want - it’s essentially a large library for mini-movies.</p>

<p>My eye is drawn to the red “What to Watch” button in the upper-left of the site but when I stand back, I am drawn to the large ad playing in the upper-center of the window. For me, neither of these areas of what I find most important about YouTube, but they might be more so to others. The ad clearly gets that space because it has been paid for. Going to my subscriptions or the search bar matter more to me.</p>

<p>If I could describe YouTube visually in 5 words it would be: <strong>streamlined</strong>, <strong>ad-driven</strong>, <strong>overwhelming</strong>, <strong>simple</strong>, and <strong>bright</strong>.</p>

<p>YouTube is the streaming video giant - it solves a user’s problem of searching for a video in a search engine, since it will very likely be uploaded somewhere on YouTube (and aided by the tag or filter systems). It also contains a lot of tutorials or news, if that’s what people ar looking for.</p>

<p>I’d described the content as <strong>vast</strong>, <strong>varied</strong>, <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>multi-purpose</strong>, and <strong>entertaining</strong>. These words are very different from my visual adjectives because they are more positive overall and they all connect with one another instead of contradicting, as the visual words do (simultaneously simplistic design with an overwhelming number of videos linked on the main page).</p>

<p>It’s honestly not always that easy to find what I want from the main page. Because of the space given to the large ad and promoted videos, accessing my favorites or my playlists has been made more difficult. I generally don’t use the primary search bar since there’s such a large volume of uploaded videos that many of them aren’t what they promise to be (footage of awards shows sometimes promise video but are pictures, other videos link to other sites). I stick to watching new videos from my subscriptions and looking at the related bar on the right-hand side, since it creates a built-in filter.</p>

<p>I feel entertained and content after I’ve spent some time on YouTube. I’ve never bought any right to promote my videos or channel (in order to get subscribers) because I primarily use it as a viewer, not an uploader, but users can pay for that.</p>

<h3 id="tumblrtumblr"><a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></h3>
<p>Tumblr is another favorite site of mine for many of the same reasons that YouTube is - I love it for the customizable experience it gives its users and for the tailored content I receive on my dashboard and reblog on my own Tumblr.</p>

<p>Since I consider my signed-in Tumblr the homepage, my eye is drawn to the dashboard whether I am up close or far away. The dashboard always has different content displayed since it is continually updating and I would definitely consider it the most important area of the site.</p>

<p>Visually, Tumblr is <strong>sleek</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>inviting</strong>, <strong>colorful</strong>, and <strong>understated</strong>. The menu bar above the dashboard invites user’s contributions with fun and colorful icons, but the overall design of the site around the dashboard is understated, letting the dashboard take the focus. Tumblr is a place to hang out and look at user-driven and -selected content, not so much to solve a problem. It has all kinds of content, like YouTube - user-made graphics, playlists, original writing, gifsets, reviews, plain old blogs/opinions, roleplays, news, and so much more! Tumblr does not contain much video, though it does have a built-in video player, but it is considered a terrible video interface - embedded YouTube videos are preferred by most users. The content would be: <strong>creative</strong>, <strong>limitless</strong>, <strong>individualized</strong>, <strong>media-driven</strong>, and <strong>entertaining</strong>. Again, Tumblr is all about the content so I consider the sleek interface to be supporting that with its dark, underplayed colors and uncluttered sidebar - the users are the ones who make Tumblr’s content, aided by the smooth and simple interface.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get to most administrative pages, like my settings or my own blog, but because of the dashboard nature of Tumblr it is not necessarily easy to find particular posts once you’ve scrolled past them (unless they’re bookmarked). Even then, there is no search tool enabled for bookmarks, so it’s not easy to find posts unless the user has reblogged them and tagged them in certain ways - and maybe even created their own tag page to help keep track of posts. But browsing through the content itself is very easy.</p>

<p>If I’m on Tumblr for a long period of time I feel entertained, happy, and thoughtful, since usually I’ve read commentary on the news, reviews on TV shows, theories about books/video games/movies from people I follow. I try not to spend too much time at once on the site, though, because as someone who does not contribute all that much, it can start to feel passive or like I’m wasting my time.</p>

<p>Like YouTube, Tumblr can promote certain blogs if a user decides to pay for that service - again, I haven’t done this, since I am content to view, think about, and reblog content instead of trying to gain a large number of followers.</p>

<h3 id="wikipediawikipedia"><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></h3>
<p>Wikipedia is like the child of Google for me - if I Google something, chances are the Wikipedia page on it pops up first and, because the site is maintained, I know the information is going to be well-structured and quickly informative.</p>

<p>From up close, my eye is drawn to the search bar, but from further away it is the puzzle-globe showcasing the number of languages Wikipedia can be explored in - emphasizing its encyclopedic nature. The globe probably is not the most important area of the site, but it does draw attention to one of the mission statements of it (since it is “The Free Encyclopedia” that anyone can edit, from all over the world).</p>

<p>Visually, Wikipedia is <strong>stark</strong>, <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>full</strong>, and <strong>educational-looking</strong>. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, so it solves the problem of those seeking to learn about something by having pages on it with references and sources. The content is information - there is a Wikipedia page on just about everything. So its content I would describe as <strong>vast</strong>, <strong>educational</strong>, <strong>well-organized</strong>, <strong>interconnected</strong>, and <strong>helpful</strong>. It’s very easy to find what I’m looking for from the homepage - I just have to type it into the searchbar, and I’m there! There’s no one comprehensive area to browse through all of the site’s content, but there are so many organizing links throughout articles, categories at the bottom of pages, and portals for academic areas that it’s very easy to move between topics that relate.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed by being on Wikipedia for a long time, since I end up clicking on the links throughout articles and can get lost reading about something that has almost nothing to do with what I first searched for. I feel that I’ve learned something every time though.</p>

<p>Wikipedia asks for donations, since it is free, but I don’t think it sells anything beyond that.</p>
