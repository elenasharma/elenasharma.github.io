    <h1>what is computer memory?</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jul 25, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p><b>M</b>emory - for us, Wikipedia defines it thus: "In psychology, memory is the process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved." For most of us non-psychologists, memory is a largely intangible idea, something we use every day but is unpredictable, sometimes faulty, and certainly not something we could upgrade if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Now for computers, memory is similar in some ways. Memory, again, refers to the storing of information so that it can be retrieved at some point, but where it is <i>different</i> is that computer memory resides in physical memory - and there are quite a few types of memory.</p>
<h3>types of memory</h3>
<p><b>T</b>here are a ton of categories we can break memory down into, so here's a quick run-through:
	<ul>
		<li>primary memory</li>
		<ul>
			<li>semiconductor memory</li>
			<ul>
				<li>volatile</li>
				<ul>
					<li>primary memory (RAM, DRAM)</li>
					<li>cache memory (static RAM, or SRAM)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>non-volatile</li>
				<ul>
					<li>flash memory</li>
					<li>ROM/PROM/EPROM/EEPROM</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>secondary memory</li>
		<ul>
			<li>"storage", such as tape, magnetic, and optical storage: tape like in music tapes, film; magnetic floppy disks; optical storage, like CD, CD-ROM, DVD</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<i>Primary memory</i> works at high speeds and its volatile types, called so because they lose data when the CPU is powered off, are really what is called <i>memory</i>. Secondary memory, as is noted above, is referred to more as <i>storage</i>, which is slower than primary memory and consists of larger and less expensive components that are farther from the CPU.
</p>
<h3>computer memory: a history</h3>
<p><b>A</b>s we can see, there's a lot to the topic of computer memory. Rather than try to cover all of these types of memory in detail, I'll offer a brief history of computer memory and how it mainly works today.</p>
<p><img class="300img" alt="two female programmers in front of ENIAC computer" src="http://technical.ly/philly/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/02/eniac4.jpg" /></p>
<p>The first electronic digital computer was called the ENIAC, for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. Operational in 1947, the ENIAC made use of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube">vacuum tube</a> accumulators. At this point, computers could really only store a few <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>, which in today's standards consist of a grouping of eight <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>. Storage locations were also specified by programs, which sent data to be recorded at a physical location (whether paper or other memory hardware).</p>
<p>Enter <i>virtual memory</i>, developed in the 1950s but not really widely implemented in computers until the 80s, which allows for better multitasking by freeing up programs to use more memory that's not in a shared space. The operating system controls where to store information, instead of relying on the user to specify locations. Memory that is currently being used by the computer will be placed, by the operating system, in RAM - which in modern computers, means that memory is placed in <i>integrated circuits</i>, electronic cicuits often made out of silicon (or other semiconductor materials). The operating system does this because RAM is faster than using the hard disk, since RAM is primary memory and thus stored closer to the CPU. If there is not enough RAM to run the programs, a lowering of performance called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_%28computer_science%29">thrashing</a> can occur as the computer is constantly moving memory between RAM and disk, unable to address current tasks.</p>
<h3>so, what <i>really</i> is computer memory?</h3>
<p><b>M</b>emory cells, consisting of electronic circuits, store data by assigning a binary address to each piece of data. These addresses connect to a physical location on a silicon chip, so the amount of memory in a computer, even if it might be called "virtual", is still directly connected to the amount of physical storage available.</p>
<p><img class="300img" alt="close up of a silicon computer chip" src="http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2012/sep/images/640_computer_chip.jpg" /></p>
<p>Curious about how your computer is storing the data you're using? Try Googling: "accessing memory addresses in ____" for the language you're programming and check it out! You can also find out how many bytes your computer can process at a time by checking out its -bit: a 32-bit CPU is able to process 32 bits at a time and if 1 byte is 8 bits, then it can process 4 bytes.</p>
