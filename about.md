I make things. 

It's what I've always done, whether it was as a child creating worlds and stories with stuffed animals or now, as a developer. 

I make something meaningful out of an idea. While sometimes that goal doesn't fully succeed in the form of a finished product, there is always meaning in the making.

This blog tells the story of how I started my journey as a web developer in the first nine weeks of Dev Bootcamp.
