			<h1>two heads are better than one?</h1>
			<h3><i>pairing</i></h3>
				<p>I certainly think so. Now that we've passed the halfway mark of Phase 0, I've seen how 
				much more productive two programmers can be together than when they're working alone. 
				Working with others helps me keep moving - if I feel like I'm stuck and I'm working alone, 
				it's much easier to either pursue it even when I'm starting to feel burnt out and I should 
				take a break or give up altogether, when I maybe could have gone further. Having another 
				person there to help assess where we as programmers are at makes a big difference - we 
				can push the other further if there's still productive work to be done or we can tell 
				the other programmer that it's probably a good time to take a break. </p>
				<p>Pairing is also great because with double the programmers, there's the potential for 
				double the creativity and output! I have really enjoyed seeing the different approaches my pairs have had for our challenges because so many times they have come up with strategies, refactoring ideas, or ways of testing/debugging that never would 
				have occurred to me. So I've loved learning from working in pairs and also teaching others about my own ideas, as they're teaching me.</p>
				<p>Pairing has only gotten frustrating when I feel like we're not on the same page or treating ourselves like a pair - if one person dominates the navigating or the driving or just doesn't seem to want to listen to the other. This hasn't happened often, though, and I think the key to avoiding this kind of situation (because no one really wants to experience it; even the one dominating must know that a give-and-take would be more productive and fun) is lots of communication before, during, and after the session.</p>
			<h3><i>feedback</i></h3>
				<p>Usually I'm excited to read my feedback! I'm a big fan of open, honest communication, so thoughtful feedback is always great to receive. Also I'm here to learn and improve, so 
				I consider feedback that is entirely positive without constructive feedback a little less useful than feedback that gives me suggestions about how to improve. So I look forward to that constructive feedback.</p> 
				<p>Based on my feedback, I need to work on maintaining clear communication throughout a pairing session instead of only at the beginning. I also need to be a more clear and direct navigator - but I still need to keep in mind my partner and where they might be at in a problem, not moving only at my own pace but making sure we're moving through the problem together.</p>
				<p>I used to be much more defensive when I received feedback, probably as a defense mechanism against the self-loathing corner of the Compass of Shame reactions to criticism. I was especially this way with my creative writing - I figured if others didn't like it, it was just me and only I, ultimately, had to be satisfied with my work. Using creative writing as my template for dealing with criticism was probably a way for me to avoid accepting criticism for a long time. So sometimes when I start reading the constructive portion of feedback I feel that old defensiveness creeping back in, but I try to squash it and tell myself - they are being kind by offering these suggestions and this is a chance to practice growing instead of being fixed.</p> 
				<p>I like giving feedback for this same reason - I really want to help my pairs become the best communicators or programmers they can be, in whatever small way my perspective could help with. Making sure I'm being actionable is my main challenge when writing feedback - it's easy to say, you're fun to work with or we got our work done well, but remaining specific and actionable, even if there's not too much constructive criticism, is what makes the feedback valuable I think.</p>
