			<h1>stereotype threat</h1>
			<h3><b><i>learning to empathize, think, and listen</i></b>
			<p><b><i>stereotype threat</i></b> - this is what Dr. Claude Steele calls, as DiversityInc puts it, <b><i>"the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. Call it subconscious self-handicapping."</i></b>That last bit packs a particularly strong punch, putting it so simply. It's a self-handicapping that we might not even be aware of, that we might not be able to control.</p>
			<h3><b><i>my experiences with stereotype threat</i></b></h3>
			<p>Though this was a new term for me, it was interesting researching Dr. Steele's work because it really put a name to what I'm sure many experience on a daily basis. But rather than attempting to speak for a group, I'll just relate some of my own experiences with stereotype threat.</p>
			<p>I was homeschooled as a kid, with my three siblings (two sisters and a brother), by our mom up through eighth grade - so it seems unlikely that stereotype threat might find its way into our academic bubble. One of the main reasons we <i>were</i> homeschooled, my mom told and tells us, was to avoid the torturous experiences of middle school where we might find that anything that made us unique made us weird or uncool, where we might start hating parts of ourselves or repressing them just to "fit in" (I think this worked out; my brother and I's affectionate term for each other was "weirdo"). But somehow, through the sports we did or other activities, stereotype still found its way into my life.</p>

			<p>One thing I dealt with, early on, was the stereotype that all homeschooled kids are weird - that they don't know how to socialize with others, that they don't know how to have friends. As a kid, I wavered between the "I don't care if I'm weird, if you don't like with me, deal with it!" attitude I got from my home environment and "what if I really am weird? What if no one wants to be my friend? What if I just don't fit in anywhere?". To this day I feel hesitant revealing that I was homeschooled; though I often gets the response, "But you're so normal!" (revealing that this person believed in the stereotype), I was always afraid of an awkward pause, some feeling that the other person might be thinking, "Well, that explains it" or that any future encounter with this person might be colored by the knowledge of my homeschooling.</p>

			<p>The most memorable experience I have with stereotype threat was in my junior year of high school when I was struggling in my honors math class - I eventually failed out of the class and had to take the "regular" level. Now that I know what stereotype threat is, I recognize my thought process behind studying less for some tests (because what was the point, when I could just spend time doing what I was good at, English or Latin) or even once I'd failed the class for what they are. I thought it confirmed that yes, I was terrible at math just like I'd always subconsciously felt I must be, even though I'd always been good at it when I was homeschooled. Though no one ever explicitly said to me, 'Women aren't good at math', clearly at some point this stereotype had ingrained itself in my mind. I was so afraid to face math again that I didn't take Calculus, a class I'd always wanted to take, until junior year of college. My taking computer science at Harvey Mudd college, an engineering school, was also something I'd always been afraid I'd fail at, and in some ways I held myself back from taking it earlier (I only took it senior year of college).</p>
			<h3><b><i>so what do we do about it?</i></b></h3>
			<p>The thing about stereotype threat is that much of it seems to come from the nebulous, external forces of the stereotypes that exist in our world. So what can we do if our fear of confirming a stereotype looms over us, holding us back?</p>
			<p>Instead of lingering on past struggles with stereotype threat, I'd like to find ways to deal with it when I - and others - might encounter it in future environments. First off, I think <b><i>empathy</i></b> is incredibly important. Though I've just spent all this time talking about my experiences, it shouldn't necessarily take me saying this stuff for it to ring true. Everyone has experienced or not experienced stereotype threat to different degrees - if we could only understand others who'd experienced it in the same exact way as us, how could we ever communicate about it or help each other?</p>
			<p>So I know there are people who deal with stereotype threat much more frequently or to a larger degree. Thinking that it's everywhere, ingrained into our culture, could easily be paralyzing - how are we supposed to fix all of the underlying problems surrounding stereotype threat? So along with empathy I would try to <b><i>keep it within reach</i></b>. It's easy to talk about this stuff as if it's theoretical, like we don't personally know anyone experiencing it or do anything to perpetuate it. We have to keep the scope within the reach of what we can affect. If we see recognize a situation as unwelcoming or see that someone might be feeling the effects of stereotype threat, we have to <i>do</i> something about it. </p>
			<p>Like what? <b><i>Talk to that person</i></b>. Ask if there's a way I can help - if I can change some of my behaviors or become more thoughtful about the way I am communicating. Or, if I haven't noticed it and someone calls me out on it, the most important thing is not only to hear that person but to <b><i>listen</i></b> - to think about it.</p>

			<p>And if I'm feeling it? I have to remind myself that, like Dr. Steele writes, intelligence is fluid. Failing at something at one point doesn't mean anything other than that it didn't work out then - it doesn't mean it couldn't work out in the future. And I have to remember that my successes or failures in any particular area do not equate to my worth as a person. Having the hope and determination that skills or intelligences are shifting things that can change with my own effort - that is how I'll have to face future stereotype threats. But I wouldn't shove all my own coping mechanisms on someone else if they came to me or if I thought they might be feeling stereotype threat. At that point, my whole responsibility would be to listen, to think, and to continue thinking long after the listening was done. And then to try to make a change.
