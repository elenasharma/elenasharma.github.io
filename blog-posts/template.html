			<h1>Post Title</h1>
			<p>YouTube is one of my favorite sites because of all the content I can access from it - plus, I've been a YouTube member longer than any other site, since I first joined it eight years ago now. Because of all this time I've been able to create a large number of playlists organizing the videos I've watched and liked over the past decade that I can still revisit whenever I want - it's essentially a large library for mini-movies.</p> 

			<p>My eye is drawn to the red "What to Watch" button in the upper-left of the site but when I stand back, I am drawn to the large ad playing in the upper-center of the window. For me, neither of these areas of what I find most important about YouTube, but they might be more so to others. The ad clearly gets that space because it has been paid for. Going to my subscriptions or the search bar matter more to me.</p>

			<p>If I could describe YouTube visually in 5 words it would be: streamlined, ad-driven, overwhelming, simple, and bright.</p> 

			<p>YouTube is the streaming video giant - it solves a user's problem of searching for a video in a search engine, since it will very likely be uploaded somewhere on YouTube (and aided by the tag or filter systems).</p> 

			<p>I'd described the content as vast, varied, personalized, multi-purpose, and entertaining. These words are very different from my visual adjectives because they are more positive overall and they all connect with one another instead of contradicting, as the visual words do (simultaneously simplistic design with an overwhelming number of videos linked on the main page).</p>

			<p>It's honestly not always that easy to find what I want from the main page. Because of the space given to the large ad and promoted videos, accessing my favorites or my playlists has been made more difficult. I generally don't use the primary search bar since there's such a large volume of uploaded videos that many of them aren't what they promise to be (footage of awards shows sometimes promise video but are pictures, other videos link to other sites). I stick to watching new videos from my subscriptions and looking at the related bar on the right-hand side, since it creates a built-in filter.</p>

			<p>I feel entertained and content after I've spent some time on YouTube. I've never bought any right to promote my videos or channel (in order to get subscribers) because I primarily use it as a viewer, not an uploader.
