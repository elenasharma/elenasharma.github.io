	<h1>Plan for new page</h1>
	<p>I'm not going to change too much about the basic layout, since I like the simple, streamlined layout of my current blog. I also know I want to keep my drop-down menu - it's a great way to navigate through my blog posts. I think I'll update that menu to not include the titles of the blog posts but only have the week numbers, since the dropdown sections will be too long if I keep in the titles AND I'll change the background of the top-level options to be a very light grey, since it will no longer be placed over the picture. I also want to update my side photo to be circular instead of rectangular. I want the top and bottom margins of the page to be increased, since right now the main text area with my post previews seems too busy/too push too far vertically. Finally, I want to add a fixed black footer bar to the bottom of the page with icon images linking to my Google plus, GitHub, Facebook, and LinkedIn pages.</p>
