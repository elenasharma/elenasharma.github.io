	<p>Here I'm learning about responsive web design; specifically, how to use the 
		calculation of target/context = result. Responsive web design is usefl
		because of the increasingly wide variety of browser sizes out there - where
		formerly it may have worked to have a desktop version of a website along with
		a mobile version, now it would be incredibly inefficient to custom-make a version
		of a website for every browser size that exists.</p>
