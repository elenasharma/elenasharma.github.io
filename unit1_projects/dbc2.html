					<h2>So, what is it?</h2>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Ever noticed something in common in the stories <span class="emphasis">told and re-told over time</span>, whether in the form of fairy tales or more modern narratives like Star Wars and the Harry Potter series? Often, some of the most memorable stories follow the protagonist from childhood or innocence as they change in the face of the challenges of their worlds.</p> 
							
							<p>If you've ever gotten lost on TVTropes and most likely even if you haven't, you'll recognize the idea of the <span class="emphasis">loss of innocence</span> - an idea instrumental for the Bildungsroman genre. Scholar Marianne Hirsch breaks down the Bildungsroman into a <span class="emphasis">set of seven conditions</span> - conditions that can be used to classify texts as members of this long-standing and popular genre.</p>

							<p>Of course, this is only one definition of the genre - there are <span class="emphasis">countless subgenres</span> within the Bildungsroman. These novels can satisfy all, some, or none of Hirsch's conditions. Some traditional examples of this genre include <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but the scope of the genre is <span class="emphasis">always expanding</span> to include novels like <i>Divergent</i> or movies like the original Star Wars trilogy.</p>
