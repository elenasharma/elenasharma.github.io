JavaScript is an extremely popular scripting language used in web 
development and as always with popular things, it seems important to 
question *why* it is so heavily used by developers.

1. One of the most widely used reasons for JavaScript's popularity is that it is easy to learn.
		
2. It also has tons of libraries - frameworks that have 
functions for common tasks that anyone can use as they are developing their project. Because of these frameworks (some of the popular ones include jQuery, Protoype, and MooTools), it would be pretty easy to create an entire app or page quickly, since functions for animations or other behaviors needed for pages that work with different browsers could be found in these frameworks or libraries.

3. Every web browser supports JavaScript - in fact, it is 
embedded in browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet 
Explorer), so it is the best option for providing a great user 
experience to the largest group of users.

4. It's fast! It is easy to instantaneously see changes or 
developments, from the developer's point of view, but it also works
efficiently for the user, again providing a good user experience.

5. Not only does it work on all browsers, it works on multiple
devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and e-readers. In an age of ever-expanding device possibilities, this is a huge plus for JavaScript. In addition, it's great for apps, which are everywhere these days!

These are just a few of the reasons why JavaScript seems so popular 
these days. It wasn't always this way, as it is over a decade old 
and has had its rises and falls in popularity, but as it is today 
JavaScript is everywhere and considered the *language of the web* by many.
