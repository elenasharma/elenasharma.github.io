<p>Not asking the <i>right</i> questions, mind you! As long as you're learning something new, it's always good to ask a question. What's important is asking the question so that potential answers will be relevant and helpful - so that people who help you will know what you need AND want to help you. How do we do this?</p>

<p>Earlier in Phase 0, while fetching changes from DBC, I ran into an odd error with my git (particularly with setting up my remote and origin). Whenever I tried to merge, it would get stuck, saying I had some file that I had to delete - but when I looked for the file, I couldn't find it! I turned to my brother, a DBC grad, for help, and the question I first posed to him was:</p>
<b><i>Help! I think I broke my git!</i></b>
<p>Clearly this wasn't the most informative way to ask for help - he had no idea what the problem was or how to address it until we screenshared and I recreated the problem. After researching the <i>right</i> way to ask questions, here are some issues with my question:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>Not specific.</b> The issue could have been with ANY aspect of git at all, so if I'm asking someone to take the time to help me, I need to narrow down the scope of my question so they don't waste their time giving me an answer that won't help me. Plus, it's my question - I shouldn't expect them to do all the work of figuring the problem out, I should present that problem to them clearly.</li>
	<li>This goes with the above issue, but <b>I didn't ask a question, I just stated a problem.</b> How was my brother supposed to know what I needed to happen and how it went wrong?</li>
	<li><b>I should have copied or screenshotted the commands that brought me to the error.</b> This would make tracing the problem much easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>My brother told me he needed some of this information as we worked through the issue, and that's when I realized I could have asked the question much more effectively. PLUS, I should have done more research so that it showed that I had tried to find my own answers. I had panicked, worried I would 'break' my git even more than I already had, and didn't want to mess with it. Honestly, there's pretty much nothing I did right with this question.</p>
<p>A better question that I asked on StackOverflow a couple weeks ago:</p>
<img class="300img" src="http://i1060.photobucket.com/albums/t460/Elena_Sharma/ScreenShot2014-07-30at52147PM_zps042a365c.png">
<p>Here are a few things I think I did right with this question:
	<ul>
		<li><b>I was specific.</b> I showed the language I was working with and I used specific terminology to highlight the exact problem I was having.</li>
		<li><b>I showed sample code,</b> enough to give context for the problem, but not so much that potential helpers would be overwhelmed by it.</li>
		<li><b>I made it clear what I wanted to happen and what was <i>actually</i> happening.</b> This saves people from having to run my code if it's just a quick fix (though running it would be easy given that it's a short, standalone piece of code).</li>
		<li><b>I tagged my post with relevant tags,</b> making the question easier to find for users tracking certain tags.</li>
	</ul>
	And what I didn't do well:
	<ul>
		<li><b>I should have framed it as a question.</b> This is a best practice kind of deal, because it helps make it more clear what I want to have happen. It's probably forgiveable in this case because it's pretty straightforward - I want to initialize my object as an array - but framing the question as such instead of a statement would make my goal even more clear.</li>
		<li><b>I could have shown evidence that I did research.</b> I did, in fact, do research - especially on StackOverflow - before asking about this syntax, but how could anyone have known that? It shows due diligence if I write something like, "I've seen other problems where this answer worked, but it didn't work for me - it gave me ___", or something like that.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The bottom line of learning how to ask a question, whether online or in person is asking <i>yourself</i>: <b>am I asking this question in a thoughtful, clear, well-researched, and respectful way?</b> Because if so, other people are probably much more likely to be inclined to help out!
