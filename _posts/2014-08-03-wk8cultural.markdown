<p>As one of four extremely talkative and opinionated siblings, conflicts among us were a part of daily life growing up. For a long time, I was a really terrible kid - obnoxious, selfish, bratty, you name it. Apparently I started growing out of that phase when I was 8 or 9 and now people have expressed disbelief that I was ever that awful... a response that makes me feel both good, because it must mean that I'm better to be around, and guilty in a way, because what if I still am that same selfish, unempathetic kid?</p>

<h3>sister argument</h3>
<p>The specific emotional conflict that comes to mind was between my older sister and I, driving home one day. I teased her, saying that she looked at herself in every reflective surface she could because she was so vain (something my siblings and I had teased her about when we were all younger), and to my shock, she reacted emotionally, starting to cry angrily and telling me that she wasn't like that anymore, it wasn't fair to treat her like who she had been. What I thought had been a light, teasing comment had meant far more to her than that - I just hadn't realized.</p>
<p>At first, I responded by attacking back: why are you reacting like this? What I said wasn't <i>that</i> bad? After all, it is partly true, isn't it? I didn't mean it to be hurtful! But more than anything, I felt guilty - I think what I said was a combination of my attacking her back so that I could channel my feelings of shame at my own thoughtlessness. I've been told I'm a good listener, that I'm empathetic - but if I defined myself like that and I had so obviously failed at being sensitive, what did that make me?</p>
<p>My counterattacks only made the situation worse - neither my sister or I like backing down, and I was convinced I hadn't done anything that wrong. When we got home we both separated for a little while, but then I couldn't stand it, I felt sick feeling that the conflict wasn't being resolved in any way. I went to apologize for hurting her feelings and we had a calmer, more constructive talk about it all.</p>
<h3>talking it out</h3>

<p>The main takeaway from that conversation for me was, it didn't matter if I didn't understand why she reacted like that - all that mattered was that what I said had hurt her. It didn't matter if <i>I</i> wouldn't have reacted in that way, as I realized I had been using myself as my measure for what would be hurtful or not. The other thing I learned is that though my method of attacking back is largly logical and measured, it is not any more helpful than more emotional attacks in a conflict. I had kept fighting with her because of my own insecurity, refusing to believe I could be so thoughtless. What I need is to take a step back, give up the idea of being 'right', and get down to the real - what those words might mean to someone else, what my intentions were, and how those are often very different.</p>
<p>I haven't seriously fought with my sister since that conflict, after our conversation. Now we know how each other think and we know that we can work through issues by being very straightforward with one another, getting rid of the potentially hurtful things that can be said in the heat of a conflict. Conflicts like these always make me feel that I'm incapable of being empathetic if I so thoughtlessly hurt someone else, making me fall into the "attack self" thoughts, wondering if it's impossible for me to change from the selfish, bratty child I was. But resolutions like my sister and I had also show me that yes, progress and understanding can be reached, and that's what I remember when I encounter other conflicts.
